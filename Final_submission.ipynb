    "<p style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> When we talk about climate change, forests often come up as both part of the solution and part of the problem. Known as “carbon sinks,” they play a crucial role in absorbing and storing carbon dioxide, which helps regulate the planet’s atmosphere. Beyond their environmental importance, forests are also home to an incredible variety of life. But when forests are destroyed, the carbon they store is released back into the air, and this contributes to global emissions. <b>Each year, forest loss releases nearly 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide</b>, which is equivalent to around 10% of all human-caused emissions (Gibbs et al., 2018). </p>\n",

    "<p style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Deforestation is, therefore, a double-edged sword in our fight against climate change.</b> Not only does it reduce the ability of forests to absorb greenhouse gases, but it also becomes a direct source of emissions, speeding up global warming. So, what’s causing this destruction? </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Agriculture is by far the biggest culprit</b>. At least <b>three-quarters</b> of tropical deforestation is tied to agricultural expansion (Ritchie, 2021). While much attention has been given to beef and palm oil as contributors to deforestation—there’s growing awareness of the environmental impact of palm oil, and younger generations are starting to move away from meat and animal-based products (Salehi et al., 2023). This shift raises an important question: <b>could other agricultural commodities become more significant drivers of land-use change in the future?</b> </p>\n",

    "<p style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Cereals might be next in line.</b> Among them, maize, or corn, stands out. <b>Corn is the world’s most widely produced cereal</b>, with nearly 1.2 billion tonnes grown in 2023, and its production has increased by 97% since 2000—faster than any other top cereal (FAO, 2023). Its uses go far <b>beyond food</b>, extending to <b>biofuels and animal feed</b>, which makes it a versatile and highly demanded crop. With its rapid growth and global importance, corn is a crop worth studying in the context of deforestation. <b>Could this staple cereal be playing a bigger role in forest loss than we realize?</b> That’s the question this study aims to explore. </p>"

    "### Our hypothesis\n",
    "<p style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> We assume that corn expansion can be done at the expense of forests based on these factors: <ul> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b> Land suitability:</b> Corn thrives in tropical climates, making regions like the Amazon and Central America prime targets for cultivation. The expansion of corn farming in these areas often leads to the clearing of forests to create arable land, resulting in significant environmental impacts, because corn is a heavy feeder of nitrogen, a vital nutrient for its growth, therefore, corn production needs new landt to replace the old land with now depleted soil nitrogen levels. For example, in Brazil's Cerrado biome, the expansion of corn farming has contributed to substantial deforestation, because the Cerrado's flat terrain and fertile soils make it attractive for large-scale agriculture (Hillsdon, 2024). </li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b> Economic incentives for forest conversion:</b> Clearing forests for corn cultivation can be economically attractive due to the dual benefits of timber sales and agricultural revenue. Harvesting timber provides immediate income, while the subsequent use of cleared land for corn farming offers ongoing profits. This combination can make forest conversion more appealing than repurposing existing agricultural lands, especially when timber demand is high. Sustainable timber harvesting practices aim to balance economic gains with environmental preservation, but the immediate financial incentives of deforestation often prevail (Griffin, 2024). </li> </ul> </p>\n",

These controls help us account for other influences that might affect the relationship, so we can focus on the role corn plays more accurately. Throughout our analysis, we will use three existing research papers, Curtis et al. (2018), Harris et al. (2021), and Bager et al. (2023),  to help us identify the other variables and construct our statistical model. They all highlight the central role of agriculture in their exploration of deforestation drivers.

    "<ul> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b> GDP:</b> Wealthier countries with higher GDP may exhibit increased deforestation due to higher demand for agricultural commodities and infrastructure development (Bager et al., 2023).</li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Corn Price:</b> Higher market demand and fluctuating commodity prices are significant drivers of deforestation, as they influence the profitability of expanding agricultural land (Curtis et al., 2018; Harris et al., 2021).</li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Temperature: </b> It plays a critical role in deforestation through its impact on crop yields and land suitability, potentially incentivizing agricultural expansion into forested areas (Bager et al., 2023). </li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Rainfall: </b> It affects agricultural productivity and land-use suitability, indirectly influencing the likelihood of deforestation, particularly in regions dependent on rainfed agriculture, such as corn (Curtis et al., 2018; Bager et al., 2023). </li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Corruption: </b> Governance quality, reflected by corruption levels, is a key determinant of land tenure security and the enforcement of deforestation regulations. High corruption can weaken enforcement and exacerbate deforestation risks (Harris et al., 2021; Bager et al., 2023). </li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Rural Population: </b> A larger rural population is often associated with increased pressure on forests, as subsistence farming and small-scale agriculture drive land conversion. These dynamics are particularly prevalent in regions where agriculture serves as the primary livelihood (Curtis et al., 2018; Harris et al., 2021).  </li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Suitable Land Available for Corn Expansion Other Than Forests: </b>This variable serves as a proxy for the proximity between cornfields and forests, reflecting whether agricultural expansion is likely to target forested areas or shift to other available lands. Countries with plenty of non-forested but usable land may reduce the pressure to clear forests for new crops. On the other hand, a lack of suitable alternatives could increase the likelihood of forests being converted into cornfields (Foley et al., 2011; Gibbs et al., 2010). This means we might observe a stronger relationship for these countries.  </li> </ul>"

This can make our analysis tricky because the results might be overly influenced by those extremes. To help up \"compress\" those extreme values and therefore make our statistical model more reliable, we’ll use a mathematical transformation called a \"logarithm\" on our variables. This means that now we’re looking at how a percentage change in the size of cornfields relates to a percentage change in the size of forests. </li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Geographic Coverage: </b>\n",
    "Our dataset spans 76 countries from 2000 to 2021, covering regions across Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, and the Americas. While this diversity provides a broad view, certain regions are more heavily represented. For example, African and Latin American countries dominate the tropical zones most relevant to deforestation, while European and North American nations are less affected by direct deforestation pressures but may influence global markets driving land-use changes. This regional variation must be considered when interpreting results.</li>"
