Known as ‚Äúcarbon sinks,‚Äù they play a crucial role in absorbing and storing carbon dioxide, which helps regulate the planet‚Äôs atmosphere. Beyond their environmental importance, forests are also home to an incredible variety of life. But when forests are destroyed, the carbon they store is released back into the air, and this contributes to global emissions. <b>Each year, forest loss releases nearly 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide</b>, which is equivalent to around 10% of all human-caused emissions (Gibbs et al., 2018). </p>\n",

    "<p style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Deforestation is, therefore, a double-edged sword in our fight against climate change.</b> Not only does it reduce the ability of forests to absorb greenhouse gases, but it also becomes a direct source of emissions, speeding up global warming. So, what‚Äôs causing this destruction? </p>\n",

    "<p style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Agriculture is by far the biggest culprit</b>. At least <b>three-quarters</b> of tropical deforestation is tied to agricultural expansion (Ritchie, 2021). While much attention has been given to beef and palm oil as contributors to deforestation‚Äîthere‚Äôs growing awareness of the environmental impact of palm oil, and younger generations are starting to move away from meat and animal-based products (Salehi et al., 2023). This shift raises an important question: <b>could other agricultural commodities become more significant drivers of land-use change in the future?</b> </p>\n",

Its uses go far <b>beyond food</b>, extending to <b>biofuels and animal feed</b>, which makes it a versatile and highly demanded crop. With its rapid growth and global importance, corn is a crop worth studying in the context of deforestation. <b>Could this staple cereal be playing a bigger role in forest loss than we realize?</b> That‚Äôs the question this study aims to explore. </p>"

    "### Our hypothesis\n",
    "<p style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> We assume that corn expansion can be done at the expense of forests based on these factors: <ul> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b> Land suitability:</b> Corn thrives in tropical climates, making regions like the Amazon and Central America prime targets for cultivation. The expansion of corn farming in these areas often leads to the clearing of forests to create arable land, resulting in significant environmental impacts, because corn is a heavy feeder of nitrogen, a vital nutrient for its growth, therefore, corn production needs new land to replace the old land with now depleted soil nitrogen levels. For example, in Brazil's Cerrado biome, the expansion of corn farming has contributed to substantial deforestation, because the Cerrado's flat terrain and fertile soils make it attractive for large-scale agriculture (Hillsdon, 2024). </li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b> Economic incentives for forest conversion:</b> Clearing forests for corn cultivation can be economically attractive due to the dual benefits of timber sales and agricultural revenue. Harvesting timber provides immediate income, while the subsequent use of cleared land for corn farming offers ongoing profits. This combination can make forest conversion more appealing than repurposing existing agricultural lands, especially when timber demand is high. Sustainable timber harvesting practices aim to balance economic gains with environmental preservation, but the immediate financial incentives of deforestation often prevail (Griffin, 2024). </li> </ul> </p>\n",

These controls help us account for other influences that might affect the relationship, so we can focus on the role corn plays more accurately. Throughout our analysis, we will use three existing research papers, Curtis et al. (2018), Harris et al. (2021), and Bager et al.

High corruption can weaken enforcement and exacerbate deforestation risks (Harris et al., 2021; Bager et al., 2023). </li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Rural Population: </b> A larger rural population is often associated with increased pressure on forests, as subsistence farming and small-scale agriculture drive land conversion. These dynamics are particularly prevalent in regions where agriculture serves as the primary livelihood (Curtis et al., 2018; Harris et al., 2021).  </li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Suitable Land Available for Corn Expansion Other Than Forests: </b>This variable serves as a proxy for the proximity between cornfields and forests, reflecting whether agricultural expansion is likely to target forested areas or shift to other available lands. Countries with plenty of non-forested but usable land may reduce the pressure to clear forests for new crops. On the other hand, a lack of suitable alternatives could increase the likelihood of forests being converted into cornfields (Foley et al., 2011; Gibbs et al., 2010). This means we might observe a stronger relationship for these countries.  </li> </ul>"

This can make our analysis tricky because the results might be overly influenced by those extremes. To help up \"compress\" those extreme values and therefore make our statistical model more reliable, we‚Äôll use a mathematical transformation called a \"logarithm\" on our variables. This means that now we‚Äôre looking at how a percentage change in the size of cornfields relates to a percentage change in the size of forests. </li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Geographic Coverage and its bias: </b>\n",
    "Our dataset heavily represents tropical regions in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, where deforestation due to agricultural expansion is most pronounced. While this focus is crucial for understanding the issue in areas with significant forest loss, it introduces a bias that could overestimate the global relationship between corn expansion and deforestation. Temperate and industrialized regions, like parts of Europe and North America, where forest cover is stable or increasing, are less represented. This imbalance means our results may reflect stronger impacts than what might be observed in regions with different land-use dynamics.</li> <li style=\"font-family: 'Trebuchet', sans-serif; font-size:16px;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.6;\"> <b>Imperfect or omitted control variables: </b>\n",
    "The relationship between corn expansion and deforestation is shaped by numerous factors.  While we‚Äôve included key control variables, we might still miss some others, because they are hard to measure or lack data. For instance, we use suitable land available for corn expansion other than forests as a proxy for the proximity between cornfields and forests, however it is imperfect as it lacks spatial precision, and doesn‚Äôt account for accessibility. Moreover, anti-deforestation policies could be an omitted variable. Given that these policies directly impact how land-use decisions are made, potentially reducing the likelihood of forests being converted into agricultural land, including cornfields, we might overestimate the effect of corn expansion on deforestation as we don't include them.</li>"
